Computer science or computing science (abbreviated CS or CompSci) designates the scientific and mathematical approach in information technology and its applications, notably computer software and sometimes hardware. A computer scientist is a scientist who specialises in the theory of computation and the design of computers. Its subfields can be divided into practical techniques for its implementation and application in computer systems and purely theoretical areas. Some, such as computational complexity theory, which studies fundamental properties of computational problems, are highly abstract, while others, such as computer graphics, emphasize real-world applications. Still others focus on the challenges in implementing computations. For example, programming language theory studies approaches to description of computations, while the study of computer programming itself investigates various aspects of the use of programming languages and complex systems, and human-computer interaction focuses on the challenges in making computers and computations useful, usable, and universally accessible to humans. Computer science deals with the theoretical foundations of information and computation, together with practical techniques for the implementation and application of these foundations
The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to computer science: Computer science (also called computing science) – study of the theoretical foundations of information and computation and their implementation and application in computer systems. One well known subject classification system for computer science is the ACM Computing Classification System devised by the Association for Computing Machinery. The ACM computer science body of knowledge is a recommended curriculum for a university-level computer science course.
Computer science in sport is an interdisciplinary discipline that has its goal in combining the theoretical as well as practical aspects and methods of the areas of informatics and sport science. The main emphasis of the interdisciplinarity is placed on the application and use of computer-based but also mathematical techniques in sport science, aiming in this way at the support and advancement of theory and practice in sports. The reason why computer science has become an important partner for sport science is mainly connected with “the fact that the use of data and media, the design of models, the analysis of systems etc. increasingly requires the support of suitable tools and concepts which are developed and available in computer science”. :de:Sportinformatik
Computational Advertising is a relatively new discipline within Computer Science that deals with algorithms of presenting the best advertisement displayed to a person, typically through an Internet browser.
This is a list of well-known computer scientists, people who do work in computer science, in particular researchers and authors. Some persons notable as programmers are included here because they work in research as well as program. A few of these people pre-date the invention of the digital computer; they are now regarded as computer scientists because their work can be seen as leading to the invention of the computer. Others are mathematicians whose work falls within what would now be called theoretical computer science, such as complexity theory and algorithmic information theory.

A computer scientist is a scientist who has acquired knowledge of computer science, the study of the theoretical foundations of information and computation. Computer scientists typically work on the theoretical side of computer systems, as opposed to the hardware side that computer engineers mainly focus on (although there is overlap). Although computer scientists can also focus their work and research on specific areas, their foundation is the theoretical study of computing from which these other fields derive.

Michael Peter Barnett (24 March 1929 - 13 March 2012) was a theoretical chemist and computer scientist. He developed mathematical and computer techniques for quantum chemical problems, and some of the earliest software for several other kinds of computer application. After his early days in London, Essex and Lancashire, he went to King's College, London, in 1945, the Royal Radar Establishment in Malvern in 1953, IBM UK in 1955, the University of Wisconsin Department of Chemistry in 1957, and the MIT Solid State and Molecular Theory Group in 1958. At MIT he was an Associate Professor of Physics and Director of the Cooperative Computing Laboratory. He returned to England, to the Institute of Computer Science of the University of London in 1964, and then back to United States the following year. He worked in industry, and taught at Columbia University 1975–77 and the City University of New York, 1977–96, retiring as an Emeritus Professor. He has focused, since then, on symbolic calculation in quantum chemistry and nuclear magnetic resonance.
Kim Cameron is a computer scientist who is currently Microsoft's Chief Architect of Access. He is the originator of the 7 Laws of Identity, and developed the InfoCard architecture.
David Karger is a Professor of Computer Science and a member of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He received an AB from Harvard University and a PhD in computer science from Stanford University. Dr. Karger's dissertation received the 1994 ACM doctoral dissertation award and the Mathematical Programming Society's 1997 Tucker Prize. He also received the National Academy of Science's 2004 Award for Initiative in Research. David Karger's work in algorithms has focused on applications of randomization to optimization problems and led to significant progress on several core problems. He is responsible for Karger's algorithm, a Monte Carlo method to compute the minimum cut of a connected graph. Dr. Karger developed the fastest minimum spanning tree algorithm to date with Philip Klein, and Robert Tarjan. They found a linear time randomized algorithm based on a combination of Borůvka's algorithm and the reverse-delete algorithm. With Ion Stoica, Robert Morris, Frans Kaashoek, and Hari Balakrishnan, he also developed Chord, one of the four original distributed hash table protocols. Dr. Karger has also conducted research in the area of information retrieval and personal information management. This work has focused on new interfaces and algorithms for helping people sift effectively through large masses of information. While at Xerox PARC, he worked on the Scatter/Gather system, which hierarchically clustered a document collection and allow the user to gather clusters at different levels and rescatter them. More recently he has been researching retrieval systems that personalize themselves to best fit their individual users' needs and behaviors, leading the Haystack project. Dr. Karger is married to Allegra Goodman, an American author. The couple lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts and has four children, three boys and a girl.
Victor Vianu is a computer scientist, a professor of computer science and engineering at the University of California, San Diego and since 2010 the editor-in-chief of the Journal of the ACM. Vianu did his graduate studies at the University of Southern California, earning his Ph.D. in 1983; he joined the UCSD faculty in 1984. Vianu's book Foundations of Databases (with Serge Abiteboul and Richard Hull, Addison-Wesley, 1995) is a standard graduate textbook in database theory. In finite model theory and computational complexity theory, the Abiteboul–Vianu theorem (also published with Abiteboul, at the 1991 Symposium on Theory of Computing) states that polynomial time equals PSPACE if and only if fixed point logic equals partial fixed point logic. And at the 2010 Symposium on Principles of Database Systems, Vianu and his co-authors Dan Suciu and Tova Milo won the Alberto O. Mendelzon Test-of-Time Award for their work ten years prior on type checking for XML transformation languages.

Wim Sweldens is a Belgian American scientist, innovator, and business leader notable for innovations in communications and signal processing technology. His image compression algorithms became part of the JPEG 2000 standard. He developed algorithms for compressing three dimensional images into billions of tiny triangular modules. At telecommunications firm Alcatel-Lucent in New Jersey, he led an effort to enable mobile operators to monitor network traffic with real-time visibility. He led development of new cell tower technology called lightRadio which reduces the size of transmission equipment dramatically into a tiny box about the size of a Rubik's Cube. A large power-hungry cell tower could be replaced by many unobtrusive small palm-sized boxes which consist of a computer chip and antenna technology. Mobile operators can offer any combination of 2G, 3G and 4G technologies. The equipment uses only basic electrical power and can be placed indoors and linked to optical fiber cables; it enables mobile networks to operate with much less electricity, halving CO2 emissions and reducing the carbon footprint, and permitting cell phone service to reach more people over expanded geographic areas. The technology may mean the end of cell towers within ten years, according to several reports. In 2012, Sweldens was president of the wireless division of Alcatel-Lucent. He is a member of the Royal Belgian Academy of Sciences and a fellow of the IEEE.

Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (10 December 1815 - 27 November 1852), born Augusta Ada Byron, was an English mathematician and writer chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the analytical engine. Her notes on the engine include what is recognised as the first algorithm intended to be processed by a machine; thanks to this, she is sometimes considered the world's first computer programmer. She was the only legitimate child of the poet Lord Byron. She had no relationship with her father, who died when she was nine. As a young adult, she took an interest in mathematics, and in particular Babbage's work on the analytical engine. Between 1842 and 1843, she translated an article by Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea on the engine, which she supplemented with a set of notes of her own. These notes contain what is considered the first computer programme — that is, an algorithm encoded for processing by a machine. Though Babbage's engine has never been built, Lovelace's notes are important in the early history of computers. She also foresaw the capability of computers to go beyond mere calculating or number-crunching while others, including Babbage himself, focused only on these capabilities.
Rear Admiral Grace Murray Hopper (December 9, 1906 – January 1, 1992) was an American computer scientist and United States Navy officer. A pioneer in the field, she was one of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer, and developed the first compiler for a computer programming language. She conceptualized the idea of machine-independent programming languages, which led to the development of COBOL, one of the first modern programming languages. She is credited with popularizing the term "debugging" for fixing computer glitches (motivated by an actual moth removed from the computer). Due to the breadth of her accomplishments and her naval rank, she is sometimes referred to as "Amazing Grace. " The U.S. Navy destroyer USS Hopper (DDG-70) was named for her, as was the Cray XE6 "Hopper" supercomputer at NERSC.

Adele Goldberg (born July 22, 1945) is a computer scientist who participated in the development of the programming language Smalltalk-80 and various concepts related to object oriented programming while a researcher at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, PARC, in the 1970s. Goldberg began working at PARC in 1973, and eventually became manager of the System Concepts Laboratory where she, Alan Kay, and others developed Smalltalk-80. Goldberg and Kay also were involved in the development of design templates, forerunners of the design patterns commonly used in software design. In 1988 Goldberg left PARC to co-found ParcPlace Systems, a company that created development tools for Smalltalk-based applications. She served as president of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) from 1984 to 1986, and, together with Alan Kay and Dan Ingalls, received the ACM Software Systems Award in 1987. She also received PC Magazine's Lifetime Achievement Award in 1990. In 1994 she was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery. Many of the concepts developed by Goldberg and her team at PARC became the basis for graphically based user interfaces, replacing the earlier command line based systems. According to Goldberg, Steve Jobs demanded a demonstration of the Smalltalk System, which she refused to give him. Her superiors eventually ordered her to, at which point she complied, satisfied that the decision to "give away the kitchen sink" to Jobs and his team was then their responsibility. Apple eventually used many of the ideas in the Alto and their implementations as the basis for their Macintosh desktop. In 1988, Goldberg co-founded ParcPlace Systems, a Smalltalk-80 licensee, as chairwoman and CEO, serving as chairwoman until its 1995 merger with Digitalk. She cofounded, and is currently working at Neometron, Inc. , of Palo Alto, California. She works at Bullitics. Goldberg was born in Cleveland, Ohio, and grew up in Chicago, Illinois.

Susan Dumais is a Principal Researcher in the Context, Learning, and User Experience for Search (CLUES) Group of Microsoft Research and an Affiliate Professor at the University of Washington Information School. Before joining Microsoft in 1997, Dumais was a researcher at Bellcore, where she and her colleagues conducted research into what is now called the vocabulary problem in information retrieval. Their study demonstrated, through a variety of experiments, that different people use different vocabulary to describe the same thing, and that even choosing the "best" term to describe something is not enough for others to find it. One implication of this work is that because the author of a document may use different vocabulary than someone searching for the document, traditional information retrieval methods will have limited success. Dumais and the other Bellcore researchers then began investigating ways to build search systems that avoided the vocabulary problem. The result was their invention of Latent Semantic Indexing. In 2006, Dumais was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery. In 2009, she received the Gerard Salton Award, an information retrieval lifetime achievement award. In 2011, she was inducted to the National Academy of Engineering for innovation and leadership in organizing, accessing, and interacting with information.

Pamela Kyle Crossley (born 18 November 1955) is an historian of modern China, northern Asia, and global history. She is author of The Wobbling Pivot: China since 1800: An Interpretive History (2010), as well as influential studies of the Qing dynasty and leading textbooks in global history. Crossley is known for a high-level interpretation of the source of twentieth centuries identities. In her view overland conquest by the great empires of early modern Eurasia produced a special form of rulership which gave high priority to the institutionalization of the concepts and practices of cultural identity. Crossley suggests that these concepts were encoded in political practice and academic discourse on "nationalism," and prevailed till the end of the twentieth century. Her book A Translucent Mirror laid out this idea with regard to China. A forthcoming book, The Mongol Moment, looks at the origins of these patterns at the beginning of the early modern period in Eurasia, while an ongoing project funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities on the rise of nationalist movements at the turn of the twentieth century looks at the end.

Jean Bartik (December 27, 1924 – March 23, 2011) was one of the original programmers for the ENIAC computer. She was born Betty Jean Jennings in Gentry County, Missouri, in 1924 and attended Northwest Missouri State Teachers College, majoring in mathematics. In 1945, she was hired by the University of Pennsylvania to work for Army Ordnance at Aberdeen Proving Ground. When the ENIAC computer was developed for the purpose of calculating ballistics trajectories, she was selected to be one of its first programmers. Bartik later became part of a group charged with converting the ENIAC into a stored program computer; in the original implementation, ENIAC was programmed by setting dials and changing cable connections. She went on to work on the BINAC and UNIVAC I computers. Bartik became an editor for Auerbach Publishers, an early publisher of information on high technology. She left Auerbach to join Data Decisions, a competitor to Datapro Research (now part of the Gartner Group) and Auerbach. Data Decisions was founded in 1980 by Elizabeth McKeown Sussman (formerly of Datapro) and Sandra Eisenberg, also of Datapro. Data Decisions was funded by Ziff-Davis Publishing in 1980. Jean joined Data Decisions in 1981 where she was a Senior Editor for the Communications Services research publication. Data Decisions was acquired by McGraw-Hill (then owners of Datapro) in 1985 and promptly shut down. Having lost her job at the age of 61, Bartik was unable to find any more work in the computer industry and instead began a new career as a real estate agent, which she remained in for most of the rest of her life.. She died from congestive heart failure on March 23, 2011. Bartik was a friend of over 60 years with John Mauchly's widow, Kathleen "Kay" Antonelli. Mauchly was co-inventor of the ENIAC. He walked Jean down the aisle when she married and it was at Jean's wedding reception that he had the courage to approach Kay about dating. Kay was also one of the six original women programmers of the ENIAC. Bartik has a museum in her name at Northwest Missouri State University in Maryville, Missouri. The museum boasts rare one-of-a-kind ENIAC, BINAC and UNIVAC exhibits, including an original salesman pot-metal model of the UNIVAC I. In addition to a BS in mathematics from Northwest Missouri State Teachers College, Bartik held an MS in English from the University of Pennsylvania and an honorary Dr. of Science from Northwest Missouri State University. In 1997 she was inducted into the Women in Technology International Hall of Fame, along with the other original ENIAC programmers.

Karen Spärck Jones FBA (26 August 1935 – 4 April 2007) was a British computer scientist. Karen Spärck Jones was born in Huddersfield, Yorkshire, England. Her father was Owen Jones, a lecturer in chemistry, and her mother was Ida Spärck, a Norwegian who moved to Britain during World War II. Spärck Jones was educated at a grammar school and then Girton College, Cambridge from 1953 to 1956, reading History. Initially she became a school teacher. She worked at Cambridge's Computer Laboratory from 1974, and retired in 2002, holding the post of Professor of Computers and Information. She continued to work in the Computer Laboratory until shortly before her death. Her main research interests, since the late 1950s, were natural language processing and information retrieval. One of her most important contributions was the concept of inverse document frequency (IDF) weighting in information retrieval, which she introduced in a 1972 paper. IDF is used in most search engines today, usually as part of the tf-idf weighting scheme. Prof. Spärck Jones was a Fellow of the British Academy, of which she was Vice-President in 2000-02.

Hava Siegelmann is a computer scientist at the University of Massachusetts and director of the school's Biologically Inspired Neural and Dynamical Systems Lab. In the early 1990s, together with Eduardo D. Sontag, Siegelmann proposed a new computational model, the Artificial Recurrent Neural Network (ARNN), and proved that it could perform beyond the Turing machine limit. This gave rise to the Siegelmann-Sontag theory of Super-Turing Computation, which has stirred a whole new field in the computer science community and received much attention from the biological and philosophical communities as well. This work introduced the term "Super-Turing computations", and, together with Siegelmann's subsequent 1995 paper in Science magazine, started the new direction in computation, realization of organic life, and foundation for better Artificial Intelligence. Siegelmann is also one of the originators of the well-known Support Vector Clustering together with Vladimir Vapnik and colleagues. She further introduced the term dynamical health, meaning that in treating disorders, it is too limiting to seek only to repair primary causes of the disorder; any method of returning system dynamics to the balanced range, even under physiological challenges (e.g. , by repairing the primary source, activating secondary pathways, or inserting specialized signaling), can ameliorate the system and be extremely beneficial to healing. Using this new concept she revealed the source of disturbance during shift work and travel leading to jet-lag and is currently studying human memory as well as cancer.

Sally Shlaer was the co-author of the Shlaer-Mellor approach to software development and co-founder of Project Technology Inc. With Stephen J. Mellor, she founded Project Technology Inc. in 1985, with the goal of making software development a rational, controllable, predictable, engineering process. As President, Sally strove to make Project Technology “a place where people could do their best work. ” Their initial ideas developed rapidly into what we know today as object and state modeling, domain separation, recursive design and translational (as opposed to elaborative) implementation. They defined and formalized their approach and disseminated it in a number of training seminars, books and articles. For many years they visualized tools that could “automate and execute” domain-separated models of requirements and by the mid-1990s they began to see the realization of that dream. Sally’s final years were clouded by chronic ill health. Although this marred her productivity, she was still able to carry out important research on recursive design. Should her writings from this time ever be published, they may prove to be the masterwork of her career. Recalls long-time friend and colleague, Meilir Page-Jones: “Sally presided over the closest thing to a software-engineering salon that I’ve ever known. She lived in what resembled a country farmhouse perched in the Berkeley foothills. Known by everyone simply as ‘The House’, it was home to a wonderful jolly muddle that Sally tried valiantly to control. I never knew who I’d find sitting around the big kitchen table: Neighbors, relatives, gardeners and world-famous methodologists would all drop by to partake of Sally and Steve’s superb cooking and hilarious conversation. Around and among it all would be an indeterminate number of cats and dogs in a kind of quantum cloud. " Born in Cleveland, Ohio in 1938, the daughter of Arthur and Naomi Slaughter, Sally moved to Phoenix at the age of 10. In 1960, she gained a BS in Mathematics at Stanford where she wrote her first software, implementing (in Fortran and assembler) code to reduce data volumes in experimental physics data. After marrying, she moved to Austin, Texas and started her family. She then moved to Canberra, Australia and attended graduate school at Australia National University. Returning to the United States in 1965, she moved to Los Alamos, New Mexico, where she designed and implemented (in SEL 810A assembler) a real-time, disk-based, multi-tasking operating system for an electron accelerator. This field of real-time and process-control software for fundamental applied physics was soon to become her hallmark. In the early 1970s, she had sole responsibility for the monitor and control software for the Los Alamos Biomedical Treatment Facility beam line. In 1977, she left Los Alamos to become software-project leader at Lawrence Berkeley Labs’ Biomedical Treatment Facility. Two years later she took an equivalent position at LBL working on the Integrated Control System project for the Bay Area Rapid Transit subway system. The mission of the ICS project was to investigate and eventually replace the unwieldy and unmaintainable software that controlled the subway at that time. It was at ICS that she first worked with Steve Mellor, who was then leader of the software-infrastructure group. Together they worked on new approaches to project management (including the project matrix) and they applied methodical rigor to the notoriously unruly realm of real-time software development. Their techniques paid huge dividends. In one now-legendary example, they showed how to replace the old Electrification subsystem, containing 70000 malfunctioning lines of Fortran and assembler, with just 2000 lines of clean, well-designed, working code.

After graduating from the Lawrenceville School (where in 2009 he was awarded the Aldo Leopold Award, also known as the Lawrenceville Medal, Lawrenceville's highest award to alumni), Lampson received his Bachelor's degree in Physics from Harvard University in 1964, and his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from the University of California, Berkeley in 1967. During the 1960s, Lampson and others were part of Project GENIE at UC Berkeley. In 1965, several Project GENIE members, specifically Lampson and Peter Deutsch, developed the Berkeley Timesharing System for Scientific Data Systems' SDS 940 computer. Lampson was one of the founding members of Xerox PARC in 1970, where he worked in the Computer Science Laboratory (CSL). His now-famous vision of a personal computer was captured in the 1972 memo entitled "Why Alto?". In 1973, the Xerox Alto, with its three-button mouse and full-page-sized monitor was born. It is now considered to be the first actual personal computer (at least in terms of what has become the 'canonical' GUI mode of operation). All the subsequent computers built at Xerox PARC followed a general blueprint called "Wildflower", written by Lampson, and this included the D-Series Machines, the "Dolphin" (used in the Xerox 1100 LISP machine), "Dandelion" (used in the Xerox 8010 model of the Xerox Star and Xerox 1108 LISP machine), "Dandetiger" (used in the Xerox 1109 LISP machine), "Dorado" (used in the Xerox 1132 LISP machine), "Daybreak" Xerox 6085, and "Dragon" (a 4-processor 6085 with one of the first snoopy caches, though never released to production). At PARC, Lampson helped work on many other revolutionary technologies, such as laser printer design; two-phase commit protocols; Bravo, the first WYSIWYG text formatting program; Ethernet, the first high-speed local area network (LAN); and designed several influential programming languages such as Euclid. By the early 1980s, Lampson left Xerox PARC for Digital Equipment Corporation; he now works for Microsoft Research. Lampson is also an adjunct professor at MIT. In 1992, he won the distinguished ACM Turing Award for his contributions to personal computing and computer science and in 1994 he was inducted as a Fellow of the ACM. In 2004, he won the Charles Stark Draper Prize along with Alan C. Kay, Robert W. Taylor, and Charles P. Thacker for their work on Alto. In 2006 he was inducted as a Fellow of the Computer History Museum. Lampson is often quoted as saying, "Any problem in computer science can be solved with another level of indirection," but in his Turing Award Lecture in 1993, Lampson himself attributes this saying to David Wheeler.

His contributions include the design of the Floyd–Warshall algorithm, which efficiently finds all shortest paths in a graph, Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm for detecting cycles in a sequence, and his work on parsing. In one isolated paper he introduced the important concept of error diffusion for rendering images, also called Floyd–Steinberg dithering (though he distinguished dithering from diffusion). A significant achievement was pioneering the field of program verification using logical assertions with the 1967 paper Assigning Meanings to Programs. This was an important contribution to what later became Hoare logic.
William Morton Kahan is a mathematician and computer scientist who received the Turing Award in 1989 for "his fundamental contributions to numerical analysis", and was named an ACM Fellow in 1994. He attended the University of Toronto, where he received his Bachelor's degree in 1954, his Master's degree in 1956, and his Ph.D. in 1958, all in the field of mathematics. Kahan is now emeritus professor of mathematics and of electrical engineering and computer sciences (EECS) at the University of California, Berkeley. Kahan was the primary architect behind the IEEE 754-1985 standard for floating-point computation (and its radix-independent follow-on, IEEE 854). He has been called “The Father of Floating Point,” since he was instrumental in creating the original IEEE 754 specification. Kahan continued his contributions to the IEEE 754 revision that led to the current IEEE 754 standard. In the 1980s he developed the program "paranoia", a benchmark that tests for a wide range of potential floating point bugs. It would go on to detect the infamous Pentium division bug, and continues to have important uses to this day. He also developed the Kahan summation algorithm, an important algorithm for minimizing error introduced when adding a sequence of finite precision floating point numbers. He coined the term "The Table-Maker's Dilemma" for the unknown cost of correctly rounding transcendental functions to some preassigned number of digits. </blockquote> He is an outspoken advocate of better education of the general computing population about floating-point issues, and regularly denounces decisions in the design of computers and programming languages that may impair good floating-point computations. When Hewlett–Packard introduced the original HP-35 pocket scientific calculator, its numerical accuracy, in evaluating transcendental functions, for some arguments, was not optimal. Hewlett–Packard worked extensively with Kahan to enhance the accuracy of the algorithms, which led to major improvements. This was documented at the time in the Hewlett-Packard Journal. He also contributed substantially to the design of the algorithms in the HP-10C series, and wrote part of their intermediate and advanced manuals.
Fernando José "Corby" Corbató is a prominent American computer scientist, notable as a pioneer in the development of time-sharing operating systems. Amongst many awards, he received the Turing Award in 1990, "for his pioneering work in organizing the concepts and leading the development of the general-purpose, large-scale, time-sharing and resource-sharing computer systems". The first timesharing system he was associated with was known as the MIT Compatible Time-Sharing System, an early version of which was demonstrated in 1961. The experience gained led to a second project, Multics, which was adopted by Honeywell. Multics, while not particularly commercially successful in itself, directly inspired Ken Thompson to develop Unix, the direct descendants of which are still in extremely wide use; it also served as a model for every other subsequent operating system design. Born in Oakland, California, Corbató received a bachelor's degree from the California Institute of Technology in 1950, and then a Ph.D. in physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1956. He joined MIT's Computation Center immediately upon graduation, became a professor in 1965, and stayed at MIT until he retired. He was awarded the Fellow Award by the Computer History Museum in California in 2012. Corbató is sometimes known for "Corbató's Law" which states The number of lines of code a programmer can write in a fixed period of time is the same independent of the language used. Corbató has a wife, Emily. He has two daughters, Carolyn and Nancy Corbató by his late wife Isabel, and two step sons, David and Jason Gish.
Juris Hartmanis is a prominent computer scientist and computational theorist who, with Richard E. Stearns, received the 1993 ACM Turing Award "in recognition of their seminal paper which established the foundations for the field of computational complexity theory". Hartmanis was born in Latvia. He was a son of Mārtiņš Hartmanis, a general in the Latvian Army. After the Soviet Union occupied Latvia in 1940, Mārtiņš Hartmanis was arrested by Soviets and died in a prison. At the end of World War II, the wife and children of Mārtiņš Hartmanis left Latvia as refugees, fearing for their safety if the Soviet Union took over Latvia again. They first moved to Germany, where Juris Hartmanis received the equivalent of a Bachelor's degree in Physics from the University of Marburg. Then he moved to the United States, where he received Master's degree in Applied Mathematics at the University of Kansas City (now known as the University of Missouri-Kansas City) in 1951 and Ph.D. in Mathematics from Caltech under the supervision of Robert P. Dilworth in 1955. The University of Missouri-Kansas City honored him with Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters in May 1999. After teaching at Cornell University and Ohio State University, Hartmanis joined the General Electric Research Laboratory in 1958. While at General Electric, he developed many principles of computational complexity theory. In 1965, he became a professor at Cornell University. At Cornell, he was one of founders and the first chairman of its computer science department (which was one of the first computer science departments in the world). Hartmanis is a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery and a member of National Academy of Engineering. He is best known for his Turing-award winning paper with Richard Stearns, in which he introduced time complexity classes TIME (f) and proved the time hierarchy theorem. Another paper by Hartmanis from 1977, with Leonard Berman, introduced the still-unsolved Berman–Hartmanis conjecture that all NP-complete languages are polynomial time isomorphic.

Gerard Salton (8 March 1927 in Nuremberg - 28 August 1995), also known as Gerry Salton, was a Professor of Computer Science at Cornell University. Salton was perhaps the leading computer scientist working in the field of information retrieval during his time. His group at Cornell developed the SMART Information Retrieval System, which he initiated when he was at Harvard. Salton was born Gerhard Anton Sahlmann on March 8, 1927 in Nuremberg, Germany. He received a Bachelor's (1950) and Master's (1952) degree in mathematics from Brooklyn College, and a Ph.D. from Harvard in Applied Mathematics in 1958, the last of Howard Aiken's doctoral students, and taught there until 1965, when he joined Cornell University and co-founded its department of Computer Science. Salton was perhaps most well known for developing the now widely used Vector Space Model for Information Retrieval. In this model, both documents and queries are represented as vectors of term counts, and the similarity between a document and a query is given by the cosine between the term vector and the document vector. In this paper, he also introduced TF-IDF, or term-frequency-inverse-document frequency, a model in which the score of a term in the a document is the ratio of the number of terms in that document divided by the frequency of the number of documents in which that term occurs. (The concept of inverse document frequency, a measure of specificity, had been introduced in 1972 by Karen Sparck-Jones. ) Later in life, he became interested in automatic text summarization and analysis, as well as automatic hypertext generation. He published over 150 research articles and 5 books during his life. Salton was editor-in-chief of the Communications of the ACM and the Journal of the ACM, and chaired Special Interest Group on Information Retrieval (SIGIR). He was an associate editor of the ACM Transactions on Information Systems. He was an ACM Fellow (elected 1995), received an Award of Merit from the American Society for Information Science (1989), and was the first recipient of the SIGIR Award for outstanding contributions to study of information retrieval (1983) -- now called the Gerard Salton Award.
David John Wheeler FRS (9 February 1927–13 December 2004) was a computer scientist. He was born in Birmingham and gained a scholarship at Trinity College, Cambridge to read mathematics, graduating in 1948. He completed the world's first PhD in computer science in 1951. His contributions to the field included work on the EDSAC and the Burrows-Wheeler transform. Along with Maurice Wilkes and Stanley Gill he is credited with the invention of the subroutine (which they referred to as the closed subroutine), because of which jump to subroutine instruction is often called Wheeler Jump. He was responsible for the implementation of the CAP computer, the first to be based on security capabilities. In cryptography, he was the designer of WAKE and the co-designer of the TEA and XTEA encryption algorithms together with Roger Needham. Wheeler married Joyce Blackler in August 1957, who herself used EDSAC for her own mathematical investigations as a research student from 1955. He became a Fellow of Darwin College, Cambridge in 1964 and formally retired in 1994, although he continued to be an active member of the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory until his death. In 1994 he was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery. In 2003 he was a Computer History Museum Fellow Award recipient. Wheeler is often quoted as saying "All problems in computer science can be solved by another level of indirection... Except for the problem of too many layers of indirection. " Another quotation attributed to him is "Compatibility means deliberately repeating other people's mistakes."
David L. Mills (born June 3, 1938) is an American computer engineer and Internet pioneer. Mills earned his PhD in Computer and Communication Sciences from the University of Michigan in 1971.

In 1975 he and Eugene Salamin independently discovered the Salamin–Brent algorithm, used in high-precision calculation of . At the same time, he showed that all the elementary functions (such as log, sin etc. ) can be evaluated to high precision in the same time as (apart from a small constant factor) using the arithmetic-geometric mean of Carl Friedrich Gauss. In 1979 he showed that the first 75 million complex zeros of the Riemann zeta function lie on the critical line, providing some experimental evidence for the Riemann Hypothesis. In 1980 he and Nobel laureate Edwin McMillan found a new algorithm for high-precision computation of the Euler-Mascheroni constant using Bessel functions, and showed that can not have a simple rational form p/q (where p and q are integers) unless q is extremely large (greater than 10).

Jack Dennis is a computer scientist and retired MIT professor. Dennis entered the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1949 as an electrical engineering major; he received his MS degree in 1954, and continued doctoral research and received his ScD in 1958. He became a full professor at MIT in 1969. He was involved in early work on time-sharing through the PDP-1 which his research group owned at MIT; that hardware later became famous in computer science history as the machine on which hacker culture started. He also sponsored the MIT student-run Tech Model Railroad Club in its early years, where the hacker culture is said to have taken root before spreading to the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab. Later, he was one of the founding members of the Multics project, to which he contributed one of its most important concepts, the single-level memory. Multics, though not particularly commercially successful in itself, was an inspiration for Ken Thompson to develop Unix. The latter part of his career was devoted to non-von Neumann models of computation, architecture, and languages. He wanted to free programs from the concept of a program counter. So adopting the concept of "single-assignment," he along with his students and others developed data flow concepts which executed instructions as soon as data became available (this specific model came to be called "static" in contrast to Arvind's later "dynamic"). He retired from MIT in 1987 to do independent projects and consulting. He developed the VAL static data-flow language which in turn inspired the compiler for the SISAL programming language. Dennis was a visiting scientist at NASA's Research Institute for Advanced Computer Science (RIACS). In 1994 he was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery. He was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 2009.

During his time there Carpenter studied for a B.S. in Mathematics (1974) and an M.S. in Computer Science (1976), both from the University of Washington. Some of his work concerned using computer technology to improve Boeing's mechanical design processes, which were still entirely done by hand on paper. In 1980 he gave a presentation at the SIGGRAPH conference, in which he showed "Vol Libre", a 2 minute computer generated movie. This showcased his software for generating and rendering fractally generated landscapes, and was met with a standing ovation, and (as Carpenter had hoped) he was immediately invited to work at Lucasfilm's Computer Division (which would be come Pixar). There Carpenter worked on the "genesis effect" scene of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, which featured an entire fractally-landscaped planet. He and his wife Rachel founded Cinematrix, a company that researches computer-assisted interactive audience participation. Carpenter invented the A-buffer hidden surface determination algorithm. The PXR24 compression scheme used in Industrial Light & Magic's Open EXR file format is based on Carpenter's work. In 2006 made improvements to the popular Mersenne Twister random number generator.

Urs Hölzle is senior vice president of technical Infrastructure and Google Fellow at Google. As one of Google's first ten employees and its first VP of Engineering, he has shaped much of Google's development processes and infrastructure. Before joining Google, he was an Associate Professor of Computer Science at UC Santa Barbara. He received a master's degree in computer science from ETH Zurich in 1988 and was awarded a Fulbright scholarship that same year. In 1994, he earned a Ph.D. from Stanford University, where his research focused on programming languages and their efficient implementation. Via a startup founded by Urs, David Griswold, and Lars Bak, that work then evolved into a high-performance Java VM named HotSpot, acquired by Sun's JavaSoft unit in 1997 and from there became Sun's premier JVM implementation. He was also Brian Reid's manager at Google and mentioned in a lawsuit by Reid charging age-discrimination. He is credited for creating Google Gulp for April Fool's Day in 2005. He is also credited for having led the design of Google's very efficient data centers which are said to use less than half the power of a conventional data center. With Luiz Barroso he wrote a definitive book on "The Datacenter as a Computer", an introduction to the design of Warehouse-Scale Machines, which is available online for free from Morgan & Claypool. In June 2007, he introduced the Climate Savers Computing Initiative together with Pat Gelsinger which aims to halve the power consumption of desktop computers and servers. In 2011, Hölzle announced a shift in Google's alternative energy investment strategy, dropping development of “solar thermal” electricity (for example with BrightSource Energy) because ST was not keeping pace with the rapid price decline of another solar technology – photovoltaics. In 2012, Hölzle introduced "the G-Scale Network" on which Google had begun managing its petabyte-scale internal data flow via OpenFlow, an open source software system jointly devised by scientists at Stanford and the UC Berkeley and promoted by the Open Networking Foundation. The internal data flow, or network, is distinct from the one that connects users to Google services (Search, Gmail, YouTube, etc.). In the process of describing the new network, Hölzle also confirmed more about Google's making of its own networking equipment like routers and switches for G-Scale; and said the company wanted, by being open about the changes, to "encourage the industry — hardware, software and ISP’s — to look down this path and say, ‘I can benefit from this. '" He said network utilization was nearing 100% of capacity, a dramatic efficiency improvement. He is a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (2009) and the Swiss Academy of Arts and Sciences He is also a board member of the US World Wildlife Fund.

Stefan Savage (born 1969) is an American computer science researcher, currently a Professor in the Systems and Networking Group at the University of California San Diego. Savage is widely-cited in the areas of network worms and malware propagation, distributed denial of service (DDOS) mitigation and traceback, and wireless security. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Washington. In 1999, Savage's research team published TCP Congestion Control with a Misbehaving Receiver, which uncovered protocol flaws in the TCP protocol that carries most Internet traffic. By exploiting these flaws, Savage proposed means for attackers to evade congestion control, allowing attackers to monopolize crowded network connections that would otherwise be shared by multiple users. This was the first paper to address congestion control evasion as a vulnerability, rather than as a theoretical design implication. That same year, Savage published "Sting", a paper and software tool that presented a mechanism to abuse quirks in the TCP protocol to allow a single party to infer bidirectional packet loss, a valuable contribution to traffic measurement. In 2000, Savage's team published Practical Network Support for IP Traceback, which proposed a simple stochastic extension to internet routers that would enable them to trace floods of traffic back to their origin. IP traceback is a major open networking research question, with significant implications towards DDOS mitigation: if IP traffic can be traced, Internet Service Providers can track down and halt DDOS floods. Savage later co-founded Asta Networks, which offered a product that addressed these problems. In 2001, Savage, with colleagues at UCSD and CAIDA, published Inferring Internet Denial-of-Service Activity, which introduced the idea of the network telescope and provided major empirical results regarding DDOS attacks. Follow-on work has provided insight into the spread of network worms, including Code Red II and SQL Slammer. In 2003, John Bellardo and Savage published 802.11 Denial-of-Service Attacks: Real Vulnerabilities and Practical Solutions, which introduced practical attacks on 802.11 wireless protocol flaws that would allow attackers to force legitimate clients off wireless networks. The paper is also a notable example of applied reverse engineering in an academic setting; Bellardo and Savage reverse engineered the Intersil wireless chipset, finding an undocumented diagnostic mode that allowed them to directly inject malicious wireless packets onto a network. In 2004, Savage and George Varghese led a research team that published Automated Worm Fingerprinting, which introduced a novel hashing technique that allowed network operators to monitor network traffic and uncover data patterns that were "propagating", spreading across the network at an unusual rate. Propagating traffic is a strong indicator for network worm outbreaks, a key unsolved problem in network security. Varghese later co-founded Netsift to capitalize on this research; Cisco purchased Netsift in 2005. In 2010 he was named a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery.

Alberto O. Mendelzon was an Argentine-Canadian computer scientist who died on June 16, 2005. Alberto Mendelzon was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He received a Ph.D. degree from Princeton University in 1979, where his advisor was Jeffrey Ullman. After that he was a post-doctoral fellow at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center for a year before joining the faculty of the University of Toronto in 1980. He was one of the pioneers who helped to lay the foundations of relational databases. His early work on database dependencies has been influential in both the theory and practice of data management. He has made fundamental contributions in the areas of graphical query languages, knowledge-base systems, and on-line analytic processing. His work has provided the foundation for languages used to query the structure of the web. Mendelzon established some of the earliest results on using the relational data model. Together with his thesis advisor, Jeffrey Ullman, and fellow Princeton students, including David Maier and Yeshoshua Sagiv, he co-authored a number of influential papers that laid out the fundamental issues and approaches for relational databases. In a now-famous paper (Maier, Mendelzon and Sagiv, TODS 1979), he introduced the chase, a method for testing implication of data dependencies that is now of widespread use in the database theory literature. This work has been highly influential: it is used, directly or indirectly, on an everyday basis by people who design databases, and it is used in commercial systems to reason about the consistency and correctness of a data design. New applications of the chase in meta-data management and data exchange are still being discovered. In the 1980s, Mendelzon began an important line of work on graphical query languages. His work has been called prescient as it began before the World Wide Web, and nonetheless established many of the scientific principles required for designing languages to query the Web. More recently, Mendelzon was a central figure in the work on view-based querying. Starting with the innovative LMSS95 paper (Levy, Mendelzon, Sagiv, and Srivastava, PODS 1995) that introduced the problem of answering queries using views, Alberto Mendelzon made several important contributions to the emerging area of view-based modeling and processing. His research was central to the development of many areas of database research such as database design, semantic query optimization, graphical query languages, and querying web data. In addition, he also made important contributions to recursive query languages, on-line analytic processing, similarity-based queries, data warehouses and view maintenance, algorithms for computing web page reputations, and indexing of XML data. Mendelzon was an active member of both the database theory and database systems research communities. He served as the PC Chair for ACM PODS in 1991 and as General Chair in both 1997 and 1998.

Dr. Kiesler has broad interests in the design and social impact of computing ranging from computer-mediated communication and computer-supported cooperative work to human-robot interaction. In her early studies with Lee Sproull and her colleagues and students, she examined how computer networking changed group dynamics and social interaction. Their influential 1992 book, Connections described the indirect, secondary effects of using email in organizations. Through field observations and experiments they demonstrated the influence of computer-mediated communication phenomena such as status equalization, personal connections and flaming. Research with Robert E. Kraut from the 1990s showed that everyday use of the Internet increased users' depression and decreased their social connections. Later research showed that the psychological consequences of Internet use depend fundamentally how it is used: communication with friends and family online has positive psychological consequences, while communication with strangers has negative effects. Her current projects include studies of collaboration and virtual organization in science, research on how individuals and groups performing analysis use visualizations, and research in the cognitive and social aspects of human-robot interaction.

Alan Mathison Turing, OBE, FRS, was an English mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst, and computer scientist. He was highly influential in the development of computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of "algorithm" and "computation" with the Turing machine, which played a significant role in the creation of the modern computer. Turing is widely considered to be the father of computer science and artificial intelligence. During the Second World War, Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School (GCCS) at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking centre. For a time he was head of Hut 8, the section responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. He devised a number of techniques for breaking German ciphers, including the method of the bombe, an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine. After the war he worked at the National Physical Laboratory, where he created one of the first designs for a stored-program computer, the ACE. In 1948 Turing joined Max Newman's Computing Laboratory at Manchester University, where he assisted in the development of the Manchester computers and became interested in mathematical biology. He wrote a paper on the chemical basis of morphogenesis, and he predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction, which were first observed in the 1960s. Turing's homosexuality resulted in a criminal prosecution in 1952, when homosexual acts were still illegal in the United Kingdom. He accepted treatment with female hormones as an alternative to prison. He died in 1954, just over two weeks before his 42nd birthday, from cyanide poisoning. An inquest determined it was suicide; his mother and some others believed his death was accidental. On 10 September 2009, following an Internet campaign, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown made an official public apology on behalf of the British government for the way in which Turing was treated after the war.
Hugo de Garis (born 1947, Sydney, Australia) is a researcher in the sub-field of artificial intelligence (AI) known as evolvable hardware. He became known in the 1990s for his research on the use of genetic algorithms to evolve neural networks using three dimensional cellular automata inside field programmable gate arrays. He claimed that this approach would enable the creation of what he terms "artificial brains" which would quickly surpass human levels of intelligence. He has more recently been noted for his belief that a major war between the supporters and opponents of intelligent machines, resulting in billions of deaths, is almost inevitable before the end of the 21st century. He suggests AIs may simply eliminate the human race, and humans would be powerless to stop them because of technological singularity. This prediction has attracted debate and criticism from the AI research community, and some of its more notable members, such as Kevin Warwick, Bill Joy, Ken MacLeod, Ray Kurzweil, Hans Moravec, and Roger Penrose, have voiced their opinions on whether or not this future is likely. de Garis originally studied theoretical physics, but he abandoned this field in favour of artificial intelligence. In 1992 he received his PhD from Université Libre de Bruxelles, Belgium. He worked as a researcher at ATR (Advanced Telecommunications Research institute international, 国際電気通信基礎技術研究所), Japan from 1994–2000, a researcher at Starlab, Brussels from 2000–2001, and associate professor of computer science at Utah State University from 2001–2006. Until his retirement in late 2010 he was a professor at Xiamen University, where he taught theoretical physics and computer science, and ran the Artificial Brain lab.

Lenat's quest, in the Cyc project, is to build the basis of a general artificial intelligence by manually representing knowledge in the formal language, CycL, based on extensions to first-order predicate calculus.
John Florian Sowa is the computer scientist who invented conceptual graphs, a graphic notation for logic and natural language, based on the structures in semantic networks and on the existential graphs of Charles S. Peirce. He is currently developing high-level "ontologies" for artificial intelligence and automated natural language understanding. International conferences on conceptual graphs have been held for over a decade since before 1992. Sowa combines ideas from numerous disciplines and eras modern and ancient, for example, applying ideas from Aristotle, the medieval Scholastics to Alfred North Whitehead and including database schema theory, and incorporating the model of analogy of Islamic scholar Ibn Taymiyyah in his works. He spent most of his professional career at IBM and is a cofounder of VivoMind Intelligence, Inc. In 1991, Sowa first stated his Law of Standards: "Whenever a major organization develops a new system as an official standard for X, the primary result is the widespread adoption of some simpler system as a de facto standard for X. " Like Gall's law, The Law of Standards is essentially an argument in favour of underspecification. Examples include: The introduction of PL/I resulting in COBOL and FORTRAN becoming the de facto standards for scientific and business programming The introduction of Algol-68 resulting in Pascal becoming the de facto standard for academic programming The introduction of the Ada language resulting in C becoming the de facto standard for DoD programming The introduction of OS/2 resulting in Windows becoming the de facto standard for desktop OS The introduction of X.400 resulting in SMTP becoming the de facto standard for electronic mail The introduction of X.500 resulting in LDAP becoming the de facto standard for directory services

Joseph Carl Robnett Licklider (March 11, 1915 – June 26, 1990), known simply as J.C.R. or "Lick" was an American computer scientist, considered one of the most important figures in computer science and general computing history. He is particularly remembered for being one of the first to foresee modern-style interactive computing, and its application to all manner of activities; and also as an Internet pioneer, with an early vision of a world-wide computer network long before it was built. He did much to actually initiate all that through his funding of research which led to a great deal of it, including today's canonical graphical user interface, and the ARPANET, the direct predecessor to the Internet. "More than a decade will pass before personal computers emerge from the garages of Silicon Valley, and a full thirty years before the Internet explosion of the 1990s. The word computer still has an ominous tone, conjuring up the image of a huge, intimidating device hidden away in an overlit, air-conditioned basement, relentlessly processing punch cards for some large institution: them. "Yet, sitting in a non-descript office in McNamara's Pentagon, a quiet .. civilian is already planning the revolution that will change forever the way computers are perceived. Somehow, the occupant of that office .. has seen a future in which computers will empower individuals, instead of forcing them into rigid conformity. He is almost alone in his conviction that computers can become not just superfast calculating machines, but joyful machines: tools that will serve as new media of expression, inspirations to creativity, and gateways to a vast world of online information. " He has been called "computing's Johnny Appleseed", for having planted the seeds of computing in the digital age. Robert Taylor, founder of Xerox PARC's Computer Science Laboratory and Digital Equipment Corporation's Systems Research Center, noted that "most of the significant advances in computer technology—including the work that my group did at Xerox PARC—were simply extrapolations of Lick's vision. They were not really new visions of their own. So he was really the father of it all."

David Courtnay Marr (January 19, 1945 - November 17, 1980) was a British neuroscientist and psychologist. Marr integrated results from psychology, artificial intelligence, and neurophysiology into new models of visual processing. His work was very influential in Computational Neuroscience and led to a resurgence of interest in the discipline. Born in Woodford, Essex, and educated at Rugby School; he was admitted at Trinity College, Cambridge on 1 October 1963 (having been awarded the Lees Knowles Rugby Exhibition). He was awarded the Coutts Trotter Scholarship in 1966 and obtained his BA in mathematics the same year and got his Ph.D. in physiology under Professor G.S. Brindley in 1972. His interest turned from general brain theory to visual processing. His doctoral dissertation was submitted in 1969 and described his model of the function of the cerebellum based mainly on anatomical and physiological data garnered from a book by J.C. Eccles. A similar model was later independently proposed by James S. Albus. Subsequently he worked at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he took on a faculty appointment in the Department of Psychology in 1977 and was subsequently made a tenured full professor in 1980. Marr proposed that understanding the brain requires an understanding of the problems it faces and the solutions it finds. He emphasized the need to avoid general theoretical debates and instead focus on understanding specific problems. Marr died of leukemia in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Marr's findings are collected in the book Vision: A computational investigation into the human representation and processing of visual information, which was published after his death and re-issued in 2010 by The MIT Press (see References). He was married to Lucia M. Vaina of Boston University's Department of Biomedical Engineering and Neurology. The Marr Prize, one of the most prestigious awards in computer vision, is named in his honor.

Rollo Carpenter (born 1965) is the British-born creator of Jabberwacky and Cleverbot, learning Artificial Intelligence (AI) software. Carpenter has worked as CTO of a business software startup in Silicon Valley, but returned to the UK to work at Icogno. As Managing Director of Existor Ltd, Carpenter is developing AI for entertainment, companionship and communication and education. His AI entries George and Joan were #1 for Loebner Prize (2005) and (2006). In 2010, Carpenter won the British Computer Society's Machine Intelligence Competition. In 2011, Cleverbot, a learning Artificial Intelligence conversationalist, took part alongside humans in a formal Turing Test at the Techniche 2011 festival at IIT Guwahati, India on the 3rd of September. The results from 1,334 votes were announced September 4th 2011. Cleverbot was judged to be 59.3% human, far exceeding expectations. The humans in the event achieved, just 63.3%. "That is rather an amazing figure. It's higher than even I was expecting, or even, really, hoping for," said British AI scientist Rollo Carpenter during a lecture at the Techniche festival. "The figures the test exceeded 50%, and you could argue all this to mean that Cleverbot has now passed the Turing Test, here at Techniche 2011. " The way that the volunteers conversed during both of these tests, fell into a 'chatty', light-hearted pattern, with the audience reportedly enjoying the process. In neither test was there a great deal of analytical thinking put into how to 'break' the bot, nor attempts made as to ask complex questions requiring logical replies. A test populated entirely by such questioners would generate a different outcome. Though it is on the way, the current Cleverbot is not designed to handle such logic - it is designed to imitate human chat. A claim of an actual pass would be ambiguous and is open to endless debate. The outcome of the Techniche 2011 event was that Cleverbot came very close to passing a 'chatty participants' Turing Test. It was sufficiently rigorous in that regard to be a valid result. He is brother of Merlin Carpenter, an artist. He now lives in Dawlish, Devon with his wife and two kids.

Wally Feurzeig is an inventor of the LOGO programming language, and a well-known researcher in Artificial Intelligence. During the early 1960s, BBN had become a major center of computer science research and innovative applications. Wally Feurzeig joined the firm in 1962 to work with its newly available facilities in the Artificial Intelligence Department, one of the earliest AI organizations. His colleagues were actively engaged in some of the pioneering AI work in computer pattern recognition, natural language understanding, theorem proving, LISP language development and robot problem solving. Much of this work was done in collaboration with distinguished researchers at MIT such as Marvin Minsky and John McCarthy, who were regular BBN consultants during the early 1960s. Other groups at BBN were doing original work in cognitive science, instructional research and man-computer communication. Some of the first work on knowledge representation (semantic networks), question answering, interactive graphics and computer-aided instruction was actively underway. J. C. R. Licklider was the spiritual as well as the scientific leader of much of this work, championing the cause of on-line interaction during an era when almost all computation was being done via batch processing. Wally's initial focus was on expanding the intellectual capabilities of existing teaching systems. This led to the first "intelligent" computer-assisted instruction (CAI) system, MENTOR, which employed production rules to support problem-solving interactions in medical diagnosis and other decision-making domains. In 1965, Wally organized the BBN Educational Technology Department to further the development of computer methods for improving learning and teaching, and the focus of his work then shifted to the investigation of programming languages as educational environments. This shift was partly due to two recent technological advances: the invention of computer time-sharing and the development of the first high-level "conversational" programming language. The idea of sharing a computer's cycles among autonomous users, working simultaneously, had stirred the imagination in Cambridge in 1963 and 1964. BBN and MIT teams raced to be first in realizing this concept, with BBN winning by days and holding the first successful demonstration of computer time-sharing in 1964. BBN's initial system, designed by Sheldon Boilen, supported five simultaneous users on a DEC PDP-1, all sharing a single CRT screen for output. Seeing dynamic displays from several distinct programs, simultaneously and asynchronously ("out of time and tune"), was a breathtaking experience. Time sharing made feasible the economic use of remote distributed terminals and opened up the possibilities of interactive computer use in schools. BBN had recently implemented TELCOMP, one of the new breed of high-level interactive programming languages. TELCOMP was a dialect of JOSS, the first "conversational" (i.e. , interpretive) language, developed in 1962-63 by Cliff Shaw of the Rand Corporation; its syntax was similar to that of the BASIC programming language, which had not yet appeared. Like BASIC, TELCOMP was a FORTRAN-derived language originally designed for numerical computational applications. Shortly after TELCOMP was created, Wally decided to introduce it to children as a tool for teaching mathematics and in 1965-66, under U.S. Office of Education support, explored its use as an auxiliary resource in eight elementary and secondary schools served by the BBN time-sharing system. Students were introduced to TELCOMP and then worked on standard arithmetic, algebra, and trigonometry problems by writing TELCOMP programs. The project strongly confirmed our expectation that the use of interactive computation with a high-level interpretive language would be highly motivating to students. Wally's collaborators in this research were Daniel Bobrow, Richard Grant and Cynthia Solomon from BBN and consultant Seymour Papert, who had recently arrived at MIT from Jean Piaget's Institute in Geneva. The idea of a programming language expressly designed for children arose directly from this project. The group realized that most existing languages were designed for doing computation and that they generally lacked facilities for nonnumeric symbolic manipulation. Current languages were inappropriate for education in other respects as well: they often employed extensive type declarations that got in the way of students' expressive impetus; they had serious deficiencies in control structures; their programs lacked procedural constructs; most had no facilities for dynamic definition and execution; few had well-developed and articulate debugging, diagnostic and editing facilities, so essential for educational applications.
Oliver Gordon Selfridge (May 10, 1926 - December 3, 2008), grandson of Harry Gordon Selfridge, the founder of Selfridges' department stores, was a pioneer of artificial intelligence. He has been called the "Father of Machine Perception. " Selfridge was born in England, educated at Malvern College and Middlesex School and then earned an S.B. from MIT in mathematics in 1945 http://alum. mit. edu. He then became a graduate student of Norbert Wiener's at MIT, but did not write up his doctoral research and never earned a Ph.D. While at MIT, he acted as one of the earlier reviewers for Wiener's Cybernetics book in 1949. He was also technically a supervisor of Marvin Minsky, and helped organize the first ever public meeting on Artificial Intelligence (AI) with Minsky in 1955. Selfridge wrote important early papers on neural networks and pattern recognition and machine learning, and his "Pandemonium" paper (1959) is generally recognized as a classic in artificial intelligence. In it, Selfridge introduced the notion of "demons" that record events as they occur, recognize patterns in those events, and may trigger subsequent events according to patterns they recognize. Over time, this idea gave rise to Aspect-oriented programming. In 1968, in their formative paper "The Computer as a Communication Device", J. C. R. Licklider and Robert Taylor introduced a concept known as an OLIVER (Online Interactive Expediter and Responder) which was named in honor of Selfridge. Selfridge spent his career at Lincoln Laboratory, MIT (where he was Associate Director of Project MAC), Bolt, Beranek and Newman, and GTE Laboratories where he became Chief Scientist. He served on the NSA Advisory Board for 20 years, chairing the Data Processing Panel. Selfridge retired in 1993. Selfridge also authored four children's books, "Sticks", "Fingers Come In Fives", "All About Mud", and "Trouble With Dragons".

Robert Hecht-Nielsen (born 1947) is an adjunct professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of California, San Diego. He co-founded HNC Software, and became a vice president of R&D at Fair Isaac Corporation when it acquired the company. In March, 2005, he held an event to announce "the fundamental mechanism of cognition", which he believes is a process of confabulation (neural networks). He posits that all actions and thoughts begin as the "winners" of competitions, where confabulations are tested for cogency based on antecedent support. He presented some mathematical models of the proposed mechanism, and some experimental results where software using this system was able to add several words to a stub of a sentence, keeping that stub coherent and, optionally, maintaining some connection to a full input sentence supplied as context. For example, given "But the other ... " the program returns "But the other semifinal match between fourth-seeded ...". Given "Japan manufactures many consumer products. " for context, and the same three-word stub, it returns "But the other executives included well-known companies ...". Five pages of such examples were given. He made red, green, and blue-striped medallions to commemorate the event, and had them distributed to the audience along with pamphlets explaining their significance: "This new era, which as yet has no name, will be characterized by the eternal universal freedom from want provided by intelligent machines."
Gary L. Drescher is a scientist in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), author of the book Made-Up Minds: A Constructivist Approach to Artificial Intelligence. His book describes a theory of how a computer program might be implemented to learn and use new concepts that have not been programmed into it. It introduces the Schema Mechanism, a general learning and concept-building mechanism inspired by Jean Piaget's account of human cognitive development. The Schema Mechanism is intended to replicate key aspects of cognitive development during infancy. It takes Piaget's theory of human development as source of inspiration for an artificial learning mechanism; and it extends and tests Piaget's theory by seeing whether a specific mechanism that works according to Piagetian themes actually exhibits Piagetian abilities. More recently, Gary Drescher has turned his attention towards philosophy. He was recently a Visiting Fellow at the Center for Cognitive Studies at Tufts University, which is directed by Dan Dennett. As a result of his studies there, he has written a book, Good and Real: Demystifying Paradoxes from Physics to Ethics, in which he defends a rigorously mechanistic materialism. In this book, he discusses quantum mechanics, defending the Everett or Multiple Worlds Interpretation, against the dominant Copenhagen Interpretation. Among other things, he argues that the Everett Interpretation of quantum mechanics, allows for a completely determinist outlook, and it undermines the views of those who hold that quantum mechanics can give us some special insights into the nature of consciousness. In this book, Drescher also provides treatments of the Prisoner's Dilemma and Newcomb's Problem in order to build a defense of the golden rule and Kant's categorical imperative which does not require that we posit anything beyond the physical world as understood by the natural sciences.

Eric B. Baum is an American computer scientist, artificial intelligence researcher and author. He is known for his materialist and evolutionist theories of intelligence and consciousness, set forth in his 2004 book What is Thought?. In his book, Baum claims that intelligence, consciousness, qualia and free will are fully explained by evolution's mandate to "exploit the compact structure of the world. " He argues that meaning and semantics arise whenever a compact description or program correctly captures a large amount of data. He sees the mind as composed of computational modules that are "meaningful" in this sense, found and improved by evolution over large time spans and largely encoded in the genome. The genome, in his view, also provides guidance to the very fast learning processes that occur during an organism's lifetime. Further the genome provides a complex of evaluation functions to guide the organism's decision processes, with the ultimate goal of maximizing propagation of the genes. The illusion of free will is seen as arising from the necessity to model future decisions of oneself and other actors, decisions that are guided by wants and desires but cannot be fully predicted. He has also developed software inspired by his theories, including Hayek, an evolutionary system that can solve large blocks world problems (named for economist Friedrich Hayek due to a bidding mechanism used by the program). Baum was awarded undergraduate and graduate degrees by Harvard University and a Ph.D. in physics by Princeton University. He has worked at the NEC Research Institute since 1990.

Ben Goertzel, is an American author and researcher in the field of artificial intelligence. He is currently Chief Science Officer of Hong Kong financial prediction firm Aidyia Holdings, and also leads Novamente LLC, a privately held software company that attempts to develop a form of strong AI, which he calls "Artificial General Intelligence". He is also the CEO of Biomind LLC, a company that provides AI-based bioinformatics services. He is Vice Chair of futurist organization Humanity+ and he is an advisor to the Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence, and formerly its Director of Research.. He divides his time between residences in Hong Kong, and Rockville Maryland (USA). Goertzel is the son of Ted Goertzel, a professor of sociology at Rutgers University. He left high school after the tenth grade to attend Bard College at Simon's Rock, where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in mathematics. Goertzel went on to obtain a Ph.D. in mathematics from Temple University in 1989, then taught mathematics, computer science and psychology at various universities, including the University of Nevada, City University of New York, the University of Waikato, and the University of Western Australia. From 1997 until 2001 he headed Webmind Inc. (also known as Intelligenesis Corp. ), a company that he had founded and that attempted to use artificial intelligence for the analysis of financial markets. This work was reviewed by the Wall Street Journal and The New York Times, explaining the approach as machine learning combined with natural language processing applied to textual information gathered from the internet, in order to predict business risk or to aid in making buying decisions. He explained his approach to creating Artificial General Intelligence in a Google Tech talk in May 2007. He defines intelligence as the ability to detect patterns in the world and in the agent itself. He tries to create a "baby-like" artificial intelligence first, and then raise and train this agent in a simulated or virtual world such as Second Life to produce a more powerful intelligence. Knowledge is represented in a network whose nodes and links carry probabilistic truth values as well as "attention values", with the attention values resembling the weights in a neural network. Several algorithms operate on this network, the central one being a combination of a probabilistic inference engine and a custom version of evolutionary programming. He claims that this combination is able to avoid the combinatorial explosions that both these algorithms suffer from when exposed to large problems. In an August 2008 audio interview, Goertzel stated that he is a founding member of the transhumanist Order of Cosmic Engineers and that he has signed up with Alcor to have his body frozen after his death, and that he expects to live essentially indefinitely barring some catastrophic accident. He also promoted the OpenCog project which aims to build an open source general artificial intelligence engine. In, 1996 Goertzel together with Francis Heylighen founded the Global Brain Group to study the global brain emerging from an increasingly intelligent Internet, and in 2011 he joined the scientific board of the newly founded Global Brain Institute at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel.

Ron Sun is a cognitive scientist and currently Professor of Cognitive Science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and formerly the James C. Dowell Professor of Engineering and Professor of Computer Science at University of Missouri. He received his Ph. D in 1992 from Brandeis University. His research interest centers around the study of cognition, especially in the areas of cognitive architectures, human reasoning and learning, cognitive social simulation, and hybrid connectionist-symbolic models. Over the years, his work has been wide-ranging, and spans cognitive science, psychology, philosophy, computer science, artificial intelligence, and social sciences. For his paper on integrating rule-based and connectionist models for accounting for human everyday reasoning, he received the 1991 David Marr Award from Cognitive Science Society. For his work on human skill learning, he received the 2008 Hebb Award from the International Neural Network Society. Throughout the past two decades, he has been conducting research in the fields of psychology of learning and hybrid neural network (in particular, applying these models to research on human skill acquisition). Specifically, he has worked on the integrated effect of "top-down" and "bottom-up" learning in human skill acquisition, in a variety of task domains, for example, navigation tasks, reasoning tasks, and implicit learning tasks. This inclusion of bottom-up learning processes has been revolutionary in cognitive psychology, because most previous models of learning had focused exclusively on top-down learning (whereas human learning clearly happens in both directions). This research has culminated with the development of an integrated cognitive architecture that can be used to provide a qualitative and quantitative explanation of empirical psychological learning data. The model, CLARION, is a hybrid neural network that can be used to simulate problem solving and social interactions as well. More importantly, CLARION was the first psychological model that proposed an explanation for the “bottom-up learning” mechanisms present in human skill acquisition: His numerous papers on the subject have brought attention to this neglected area in cognitive psychology. He is the founding co-editor-in-chief of the journal Cognitive Systems Research, and also serves on the editorial boards of many other journals. He was the general chair and the program chair of CogSci 2006, and the program chair of IJCNN 2007. He is a member of the Governing Boards of Cognitive Science Society and of International Neural Networks Society. Another strand of his work is what he called cognitive social sciences --- the re-unification of the cognitive and social sciences through grounding the social sciences in the cognitive sciences. In recent years, he attempted the difficult task of laying the theoretical and meta-theoretical foundation for computational cognitive modeling (or computational psychology), through the philosophical work of constructive empiricism, which is opposed to scientific realism.

Patrick John Hayes or Pat Hayes (21 August 1944) is a British computer scientist who lives and works in the United States. As of March 2006, he is a Senior Research Scientist at the Institute for Human and Machine Cognition in Pensacola, Florida. He received a B.A. in Mathematics from University of Cambridge and a Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence from University of Edinburgh. Pat Hayes has been an active, prolific, and influential figure in Artificial Intelligence for over five decades. He has a reputation for being provocative but also quite humorous. One of his earliest publications, with John McCarthy, was the first thorough statement of the basis for the AI field of logical knowledge representation, introducing the notion of situation calculus, representation and reasoning about time, fluents, and the use of logic for representing knowledge in a computer. His next major contribution was the seminal work on "Naive Physics", which anticipated the expert systems movement in many ways and called for researchers in AI to actually try to represent knowledge in computers. Although not the first to mention the word "ontology" in computer science (that distinction belongs to John McCarthy), Hayes was one of the first to actually do it, and inspired an entire generation of researchers in knowledge engineering, logical formalizations of commonsense reasoning, and ontology. In the middle 1990s, while serving as president of AAAI, Hayes began a series of attacks on critics of AI, mostly phrased in an ironic light, and (together with his colleague Kenneth Ford) invented an award named after Simon Newcomb to be given for the most ridiculous argument "disproving" the possibility of AI. The Newcomb Awards are announced in the AI Magazine published by AAAI. At the turn of the century he became active in the Semantic Web community, contributing substantially (perhaps solely) to the revised semantics of RDF known as RDF-Core, one of the three designers of the Web Ontology Language semantics, and most recently contributed to SPARQL. He is also, along with philosopher Christopher Menzel the primary designer of the ISO Common Logic standard. He has been secretary of AISB, chairman and trustee of IJCAI, associate editor of Artificial Intelligence Journal, a governor of the Cognitive Science Society and president of American Association for Artificial Intelligence. Hayes is a charter Fellow of AAAI and of the Cognitive Science Society According to his website, his current research interests include "knowledge representation and automatic reasoning, especially the representation of space and time; the semantic web; ontology design; and the philosophical foundations of AI and computer science".
Leslie Gabriel Valiant (born 28 March 1949) is a British computer scientist and computational theorist. Valiant is world-renowned for his work in theoretical computer science.

Edward ("Ted") Hance Shortliffe is a Canadian-born American biomedical informatician, physician, and computer scientist. Shortliffe is a pioneer in the use of artificial intelligence in medicine. He was the principal developer of the clinical expert system MYCIN, one of the first rule-based artificial intelligence expert systems, which obtained clinical data interactively from a physician user and was used to diagnose and recommend treatment for severe infections. While never used in practice (because it preceded the era of local-area networking and could not be integrated with patient records and physician workflow), its performance was shown to be comparable to and sometimes more accurate than that of Stanford infectious disease faculty. This spurred the development of a wide range of activity in the development of rule-based expert systems, knowledge representation, belief nets and other areas, and its design greatly influenced the subsequent development of computing in medicine. He is also regarded as a founder of the field of biomedical informatics, and in 2006 received one of its highest honors, the Morris Collen Award given by the American College of Medical Informatics (ACMI). He has held administrative positions in academic medicine, research and national bodies including the Institute of Medicine, American College of Physicians, the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, and National Library of Medicine (NLM), and been influential in the development of medicine, computing and biomedical informatics nationally and internationally. His interests include the broad range of issues related to integrated medical decision-support systems and their implementation, biomedical informatics and medical education and training, and the Internet in medicine.

Masahiro Mori is a Japanese roboticist noted for his pioneering work on the emotional response of humans to non-human entities, as well as for his views on religion and robots. The ASIMO robot was designed by one of Masahiro's students. In 1970, Mori published "Bukimi No Tani" in Energy. The article forwarded the hypothesis that as robots become more humanlike, they appear more familiar until a point is reached at which subtle imperfections of appearance make them look eerie. The observation led Mori to the belief that robot builders should not attempt to make their creations overly lifelike in appearance and motion. In 1974, Mori published The Buddha in the Robot: a Robot Engineer's Thoughts on Science and Religion in which he discussed the metaphysical implications of robotics. In the book, he wrote "I believe robots have the buddha-nature within them--that is, the potential for attaining buddhahood. " In 1988, Mori founded the first nation-wide robot-building competition in Japan and has widely promoted robot competitions in the years since then. Of Robocon, Mori has said, "When we lose ourselves in an activity, we become creative, friendly and funny. Think of how children are when they are playing. They are completely absorbed in the game; their eyes shine and they are all smiles. They're into the game, not themselves. That's the message of Robocon, too: To not be self-centered, but to love others and share the joy of creating wonderful things. " Mori is currently president of the Mukta Research Institute, which he founded in Tokyo in order to promote his views on religion and robots. The institute also provides consultation on the use of automation and robotics in industry.

Although acknowledged as a major influence on popular competitions pitting remote-controlled robots and machines against each other, such as BattleBots and Robot Wars, Pauline shies away from rules-bound competition preferring a more anarchic approach. Machines are liberated and re-configured away from the functions they were originally meant to perform. Pauline has written of SRL, "Since its inception SRL has operated as an organization of creative technicians dedicated to re-directing the techniques, tools, and tenets of industry, science, and the military away from their typical manifestations in practicality, product or warfare. " Since its beginning through the end of 2006, SRL has conducted about 48 shows. In the summer of 1982, Pauline blew his hand off while experimenting with solid rocket fuel. In August 1990, ArtPark, a state-sponsored arts festival in Lewiston, New York, cancelled a Pauline performance when it turned out he intended "to cover a sputtering Rube Goldberg spaceship with numerous Bibles" that would "serve as thermal protective shields" and be burned to ashes in the course of the performance. According to Pauline "I like to make machines that can just do their own shows... machines that can do all that machines in the science fiction novels can do. I want to be there to make those dreams real."

A notable development of the laboratory is the actroid, a humanoid robot with lifelike appearance and visible behaviour such as facial movements. In robot development, Professor Ishiguro concentrates on the idea of making a robot that is as similar as possible to a live human being; at the unveiling in July 2005 of the "female" android named Repliee Q1Expo, he was quoted as saying "I have developed many robots before, but I soon realised the importance of its appearance. A human-like appearance gives a robot a strong feeling of presence. ... Repliee Q1Expo can interact with people. It can respond to people touching it. It's very satisfying, although we obviously have a long way to go yet. " In his opinion, it may be possible to build an android that is indistinguishable from a human, at least during a brief encounter. Ishiguro has made an android that resembles him, called the Geminoid.

Homayoon Kazerooni is a roboticist and professor of Mechanical Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. Dr. Kazerooni is the director of the Berkeley Robotics and Human Engineering Laboratory and also the Co-founder and Chief Scientist of Berkeley Bionics . The Berkeley Robotics and Human Engineering Laboratory is also affectionately known as "KAZ LAB". Dr. Kazerooni’s work focuses on the control of human-machine systems specific to lower human extremities. After developing BLEEX, ExoHiker, and ExoClimber – three super-light, load-carrying exoskeletons – Berkeley Bionics and his team created HULC (Human Universal Load Carrier). It is the first energetically-autonomous, orthotic, lower extremity exoskeleton, providing the ability for its user to carry 200-pound weights over any sort of terrain for an extended period of time without undue effort. These exoskeletons reduce the possibility of the wearer becoming fatigued and reaching their physiological endurance limit during critical military or industrial missions. HULC technology is currently licensed to Lockheed Martin for military applications. Dr. Kazerooni is currently working on extending this technology to aid persons who have experienced a stroke, spinal cord injuries or medical conditions that obligate them to use a wheelchair. In 2011, the Berkeley Robotics and Human Engineering Laboratory enabled Austin Whitney, a paraplegic student at the University of California, Berkeley, to walk for commencement . Dr. Kazerooni has started a project to develop low-cost exoskeleton systems to enable independence for individuals with gait deficiencies called the AUSTIN Project . The Austin project is named after the first pilot for their medical exoskeleton. Prior to his research work on lower extremity exoskeletons, Dr. Kazerooni led his team to successfully develop robotics systems that enhance human upper extremity strength. The results of this work led to a new class of intelligent assist devices currently being used by workers worldwide for manipulating heavy objects in distribution centers and factories. Dr. Kazerooni has also been conducting research on human performance in coordinated haptic-visual virtual environments under several contracts from NASA. Other research interests are biomimetic design, haptics, non-linear control systems, embedded systems, networked control systems, power regeneration, monopropellant and portable energy generation methods for mobile platforms. Early in his career, Dr. Kazerooni was a recipient of the outstanding ASME Investigator Award, and has also won Discover Magazine’s Technological Innovation Award, and the McKnight-Land Grant Professorship. His research was recognized as the most innovative technology of the year in New York Times Magazine. He has served in a variety of leadership roles in the robotics community notably editor of two journals: ASME Journal of Dynamics Systems and Control and IEEE Transaction on Mechatronics. Dr. Kazerooni holds a Doctorate in Mechanical Engineering from MIT and has over 30 years of mechanical engineering experience. He has published more than two hundred articles, delivered over 70 plenary lectures in the U.S. and internationally, and holds seventeen pertinent patents. As a noted authority on robotics, he is frequently profiled and quoted in the media.

Joseph Mundy did early work in computer vision and projective geometry using LISP, when computer vision still was a new area of research. In 1987 he presented his work in a video, which now is available for free at archive. org. Here is an extract of the interview, which took place in the end of the video. "What do students need to learn to be prepared to meet the challenges?" - "I would like to comment on the necessary courses a student should take to really be prepared to carry out research in model-based vision. As we can see the geometry of image projection and the mathematics of transformation is a very key element in studying this field, but there are many other issues the student has to be prepared for. If we are going to talk about segmenting images and getting good geometric clues, we have to understand the relationship between the intensity of image data and its underlying geometry. And this would lead the student into such areas as optics, illumination theory, theory of shadows and the like. And also the mathematics underlying this kind of computations would of course require signal processing theory, fourier transform theory and the like. And in dealing with algebraic surfaces such as this curved surfaces as we talked about here, courses in algebraic geometry and higher pure forms of algebra will prove to be necessary in order to make any kind of progress in research to handle curved surfaces. So, I guess the bottom line of what I'm saying is: math courses, particularly those associated with geometric aspects will be key in all of this."

Hugh Christopher Longuet-Higgins FRS was both a theoretical chemist and a cognitive scientist. He was born on April 11, 1923 in Lenham, Kent, England and died on March 27, 2004. He was educated at The Pilgrims' School, Winchester, and Winchester College. In 1941, he won a scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford. He read chemistry, but also took Part I of a degree in Music. He was a Balliol organ scholar. As an undergraduate he proposed the correct structure of the chemical compound diborane (B2H6), which was then unknown because it turned out to be different from structures in contemporary chemical valence theory. This was published with his tutor, R. P. Bell. He completed a DPhil at the University of Oxford under the supervision of Charles Coulson. This was followed by post-doctoral work at the University of Chicago and the University of Manchester. In 1952, he was appointed Professor of Theoretical Physics at King's College, London, and in 1954 became John Humphrey Plummer Professor of Theoretical Chemistry at Cambridge, and a Fellow of Corpus Christi College. He became interested in the brain and the new field of artificial intelligence. As a consequence, in 1967, he made a major change in his career by moving to the University of Edinburgh to co-found the Department of Machine intelligence and perception, with Richard Gregory and Donald Michie. He later moved to the experimental psychology department at Sussex University, Brighton, England. In 1981 he introduced the essential matrix to the computer vision community in a paper which also included the eight-point algorithm for the estimation of this matrix. He retired in 1988. At the time of his death, in 2004, he was Professor Emeritus at the University of Sussex. In 2005 the "Longuet-Higgins Prize for Fundamental Contributions in Computer Vision that Have Withstood the Test of Time" was created in his honor. The prize is awarded every year at the IEEE Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Conference for up to two distinguished papers published at that same conference ten years earlier. He was a Fellow of the Royal Society and of the International Academy of Quantum Molecular Science. His work on developing computational models of music understanding was recognized in the nineties by the award of an Honorary Doctorate of Music by Sheffield University. An example of Longuet-Higgins's writings, introducing the field of music cognition: 'You're browsing, let us imagine, in a music shop, and come across a box of faded pianola rolls. One of them bears an illegible title, and you unroll the first foot or two, to see if you can recognize the work from the pattern of holes in the paper. Are there four beats in the bar, or only three? Does the piece begin on the tonic, or some other note? Eventually you decide that the only way of finding out is to buy the roll, take it home, and play it on the pianola. Within seconds your ears have told you what your eyes were quite unable to make out—that you are now the proud possessor of a piano arrangement of "Colonel Bogey"'.

Claude Elwood Shannon (April 30, 1916 – February 24, 2001) was an American mathematician, electronic engineer, and cryptographer known as "the father of information theory". Shannon is famous for having founded information theory with one landmark paper published in 1948. But he is also credited with founding both digital computer and digital circuit design theory in 1937, when, as a 21-year-old master's student at MIT, he wrote a thesis demonstrating that electrical application of Boolean algebra could construct and resolve any logical, numerical relationship. It has been claimed that this was the most important master's thesis of all time. Shannon contributed to the field of cryptanalysis during World War II and afterwards, including basic work on code breaking.

" He clarified these ideas more fully in his 1964 publications, "A Formal Theory of Inductive Inference," Part I and Part II. Algorithmic probability is a mathematically formalized combination of Occam's razor, and the Principle of Multiple Explanations. It is a machine independent method of assigning a probability value to each hypothesis (algorithm/program) that explains a given observation, with the simplest hypothesis (the shortest program) having the highest probability and the increasingly complex hypotheses receiving increasingly small probabilities. Although he is best known for algorithmic probability and his general theory of inductive inference, he made many other important discoveries throughout his life, most of them directed toward his goal in artificial intelligence: to develop a machine that could solve hard problems using probabilistic methods.
Leonid Anatolievich Levin (Le-oh-NEED LE-vin; Russian: Леони́д Анато́льевич Ле́вин; born November 2, 1948) is a Soviet-American computer scientist. He obtained his master degree in 1970 and a Ph.D. equivalent in 1972 at Moscow University where he studied under Andrey Kolmogorov. Later, he emigrated to the U.S. in 1978 and also earned a Ph.D. at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1979. His advisor at MIT was Albert R. Meyer. He is well known for his work in randomness in computing, algorithmic complexity and intractability, average-case complexity, foundations of mathematics and computer science, algorithmic probability, theory of computation, and information theory. His life is described in a chapter of the book Out of Their Minds: The Lives and Discoveries of 15 Great Computer Scientists. Levin and Stephen Cook independently discovered the existence of NP-complete problems. This NP-completeness theorem, often called the Cook-Levin Theorem, was a basis for one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems declared by the Clay Mathematics Institute with a $1,000,000 prize offered. The Cook–Levin theorem was a breakthrough in computer science and is the foundation of computational complexity. Levin's journal article on this theorem was published in 1973; he had lectured on the ideas in it for some years before that time, though complete formal writing of the results took place after Cook's publication. He is currently a professor of computer science at Boston University, where he began teaching in 1980.

An abbreviated version appeared earlier (January 1962) in the IRE Transactions on Information Theory and was republished in the 1974 IEEE Press volume, Key Papers in The Development of Information Theory, edited by Elwyn Berlekamp. This paper won an IEEE Information Theory Society Golden-Jubilee Paper Award in 1998 and its subject matter is a very active area of research today. Gallager's January 1965 paper in the IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, "A Simple Derivation of the Coding Theorem and some Applications, won the 1966 IEEE W.R.G. Baker Award "for the most outstanding paper, reporting original work, in the Transactions, Journals and Magazines of the IEEE Societies, or in the Proceedings of the IEEE" and also won another IEEE Information Theory Society Golden-Jubilee Paper Award in 1998. His book, Information Theory and Reliable Communication, Wiley 1968, placed Information Theory on a sound mathematical foundation and is still considered by many as the standard textbook on information theory. In the mid-1970s, Gallager's research focus shifted to data networks, focusing on distributed algorithms, routing, congestion control, and random access techniques. Data Networks, Prentice Hall, 1988, second edition 1992, co-authored with Dimitri Bertsekas, helped provide a conceptual foundation for this field. His June 1993 joint paper with Abhay K. Parekh, "A generalized processor sharing approach to flow control" in ISN won the IEEE Communication Society's William Bennett Prize Paper Award "for the best original paper published in the IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking in the past year" and a preliminary version won the Prize Paper Award for Infocom 1993. In the 1990s, Gallager's interests shifted back to information theory and to stochastic processes. He wrote the 1996 textbook, Discrete Stochastic Processes. Gallager's current interests are in information theory, wireless communication, all optical networks, data networks, and stochastic processes. Over the years, Gallager has taught and mentored many graduate students, many of whom are now themselves leading researchers in their fields. He received the M.I.T. Graduate Student Council Teaching Award for 1993. Gallager's latest textbook, Principles of Digital Communication was published by Cambridge University Press in 2008. Gallager was instrumental in the founding of Codex Corporation in 1962 (now part of Motorola) and consulted there for many years. He served Codex as Acting Vice President for Research in 1971-1972. His fundamental studies on quadrature amplitude modulation and detection led directly to the 9600 bit/s modems that provided Codex's commercial success. He has also consulted for the M.I.T. Lincoln Laboratory and a number of other companies. He has been granted five patents on his inventions. Gallager was President of the IEEE Information Theory Society in 1971, a member of its Board of Governors from 1965 to 1972 and again from 1979 to 1988.

The term information scientist developed in the latter part of the twentieth century to describe an individual, usually with a relevant subject degree or high level of subject knowledge, providing focused information to scientific and technical research staff in industry, a role quite distinct from and complementary to that of a librarian. Developments in end-user searching, together with some convergence between the roles of librarian and information scientist, have led to a diminution in its use in this context, and the term information officer or information professional are also now used. The term was, and is, also used for an individual carrying out research in information science. Brian C. Vickery mentions that the Institute of Information Scientists (IIS) was established in London during 1958 and lists the criteria put forward by this institute "Criteria for Information Science" (appendix 1) as well as his own "Areas of study in information science" (appendix 2). The IIS merged with the Library Association in 2002 to form the Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals (CILIP).

Karl J. Lieberherr is a Professor of Computer Science at Northeastern University, in Boston. He did his studies at ETH Zurich, obtaining an M.S. in 1973 and a Ph.D. in 1977. He wrote the first book about adaptive programming. The work on this theme was one of several secondary influences on the development of aspect-oriented programming. Adaptive programming tries to create applications that are easy to maintain and evolve, creating a new abstraction layer in the design and implementation of Object-Oriented Applications. This concept takes encapsulation to a new level allowing changes in the way an object works without changing the interface with other objects. This technique solves the situations where an object takes assumptions about how other objects work and a change in this object takes down that assumption creating a chain effect in the rest of the system. Aspect oriented programming affects the way an application is created. Following the directives of this concept, one could create separate objects that treat data and process in a separated way. This allows a flexible application that can change and evolve easily.

Jean David Ichbiah (25 March 1940 – 26 January 2007) was a French-born computer scientist and the chief designer (from 1977–1983) of Ada, a general-purpose, strongly typed programming language with certified validated compilers. At the time, he was a member of the Programming Research division at CII Honeywell Bull (CII-HB) in Louveciennes, France. He had previously designed an experimental system implementation language called LIS (1972–1974), based on Pascal and Simula (in fact, he had been chairman of the Simula User's Group), and was one of the founding members of IFIP WG 2.4 on Systems Implementation Languages. Ichbiah's team submitted the language design called "Green" to the competition to choose the United States Department of Defense's embedded programming language. When Green was selected in 1978, he continued as chief designer of the language, renamed "Ada". In 1980, Ichbiah left CII-HB and founded the Alsys corporation in La Celle-Saint-Cloud, which continued language definition to standardize Ada 83, and later went into the Ada compiler business, also supplying special validated compiler systems to NASA, the US Army, and others. He later moved to the Waltham, Massachusetts subsidiary of Alsys. Ichbiah designed the keyboard layout FITALY which is specifically optimized for stylus or touch-based input, and subsequently started the Textware company, which sells text entry software for PDAs and tablet PCs, as well as text-entry software for medical transcription on PCs. In 1979, Jean Ichbiah was designated a "chevalier" (knight) of the French Legion of Honor and a "correspondent" of the French Academy of Sciences. He received a Certificate of Distinguished Service from the DoD for his work on Ada. He was a descendant of Jews from Thessaloniki who emigrated to France. Jean Ichbiah died from complications of a brain tumor on January 26, 2007.

Daniel Paul Friedman (born 1944) is a professor of Computer Science at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana. His research focuses on programming languages, and he is a prominent author in the field. With David Wise, Friedman wrote a highly influential paper on lazy programming, specifically on lazy streams. The paper, entitled "Cons should not evaluate its arguments," is one of the first publications pushing for the exploration of a programming style with potentially infinite data structures and a form of programming that employs no computational effects (though programs may diverge). Over the 1970s, Friedman and Wise explored the topic in depth and also considered extensions to the world of parallel computing. In the 1980s, Friedman turned to the study of Scheme. He explored the use of macros for defining programming languages; with Kohlbecker, Felleisen, and Duba, he co-introduced the notion of 'hygienic macros' in a 1986 LFP paper that is still widely cited today. With Haynes and Wand, he simultaneously studied the nature of continuation objects, their uses, and the possibilities of constraining them. Following that, Friedman and Felleisen introduced a lambda calculus with continuations and control operators. Their work has spawned work on semantics, connections between classical logic and computation, and practical extensions of continuations. Friedman is also a prolific text book author. His first text book, The Little LISPer, dates back to 1974 and is still in print in its fourth edition, now called The Little Schemer. Friedman and Felleisen wrote three more "little" books in the 1990s: The Little MLer, The Seasoned Schemer, and A Little Java, A Few Patterns. Friedman is also the lead author of Essentials of Programming Languages, a text book on programming languages. As such, it changed the landscape of language text books in the 1980s, shifting the focus from surveys of languages to the study of principles via series of interpreters. Today's text books on this topic tend to follow this organization, though use operational semantics and type theory instead of interpreters. Like The Little LISPer, Essentials of Programming Languages is a long-living book and is in its third edition now. Most recently, Friedman resumed work on his "Little" series with The Reasoned Schemer (with Byrd and Kiselyov), explaining logic programming via an extension of Scheme.

His work triggered research in the ML community on mutually recursive modules and in the object-oriented community on mixins and traits. Flatt served as one of four editors of the Revised^6 Report on the Scheme programming language. The report is influenced by his design of Racket, especially the module system, the exception system, the record system, the macro system, and library links. Flatt's presentations are well known in the functional programming community for their executable and meta-circular nature. He is known to implement his presentations as Racket programs and to demonstrate this fact by executing the talk on the talk or for creating the talk during the talk.
Robert Bruce Findler, colloquially known as "Robby", is a computer scientist, currently teaching at the Northwestern University. He is also a member of the PLT group and, as such, responsible for the creation and maintenance of DrRacket. In addition to DrRacket, Findler has contributed numerous components to Racket and supervises its Web-based software library, called PLaneT. Findler is also a leading team member of the ProgramByDesign project. Findler received his PhD at Rice University under the direction of Matthias Felleisen. His dissertation was on the linguistics of software contracts, popularly known as design by contract. His main contribution to software contracts is a more careful accounting of blame, thereby helping quickly programmers home in on the faulty part of a software system. In addition to DrRacket and software contracts, Findler focuses on the design and implementation of a workbench for semantics engineers. This workbench, called Redex, is a tool for specifying and executing the reduction semantics of a programming language. It is already widely used by programming language researchers in the US and Europe. Most recently, SUN's Fortress research team used Redex to specify and explore key parts of their language. Findler served as the semantics editor of the Revised^6 Report on the Scheme programming language. He and his PhD student Jacob Matthews have developed a Redex model of the core semantics, which is included as an appendix of the report. The appendix plays the same role as Standard ML's formal specification (Milner, Tofte, Harper, MacQueen) but is executable and thus can visualize individual examples.

Peter Naur (born 25 October 1928) is a Danish pioneer in computer science and Turing award winner. His last name is the N in the BNF notation, used in the description of the syntax for most programming languages. He contributed to the creation of the ALGOL 60 programming language. He began his career as an astronomer for which he received his PhD degree in 1957, but his encounter with computers led to a change of profession. From 1959 to 1969, he was employed at Regnecentralen, the Danish computing institute, while at the same time giving lectures at the Niels Bohr Institute and the Technical University of Denmark. From 1969 to 1998 Naur was a professor of computer science at University of Copenhagen. His main areas of inquiry are design, structure and performance of computer programs and algorithms. Areas such as software engineering and software architecture have also been pioneered by Naur. In his book Computing: A Human Activity (1992), which is a collection of his contributions to computer science, he rejects the formalist school of programming that view programming as a branch of mathematics. He does not like being associated with the Backus-Naur form (attributed to him by Donald Knuth) and says that he would prefer it to be called the Backus Normal Form. Naur was married to the computer scientist Christiane Floyd. Naur dislikes the very term computer science and suggests it be called datalogy. This term has also been adopted in Denmark and in Sweden as datalogi. In later years he has also been quite outspoken of the pursuit of science as a whole: Naur can possibly be identified with the empiricist school, that tells that one shall not seek deeper connections between things that manifest themselves in the world, but keep to the observable facts. He has attacked both certain strands of philosophy and psychology from this viewpoint. He is also currently developing a theory of human thinking which he calls Synapse-State Theory of Mental Life. Naur won the 2005 ACM A.M. Turing Award for his work on defining the ALGOL 60 programming language. In particular, his role as editor of the influential "Report on the Algorithmic Language ALGOL 60" with its pioneering use of BNF was recognized. Naur is the only Dane to have won the Turing Award.
Adriaan van Wijngaarden (2 November 1916 – 7 February 1987) was an important mathematician and computer scientist who is considered by many to have been the founding father of informatica in the Netherlands. Even though he was trained as an engineer, van Wijngaarden would emphasize and promote the mathematical aspects of computing, first in numerical analysis, then in programming languages and finally in design principles of programming languages. His education was in mechanical engineering, for which he received a degree from Delft University of Technology in 1939. He then studied for a doctorate in hydrodynamics, but then abandoned the area. He joined the Nationaal Luchtvaartlaboratorium in 1945 and went with a group to England the following year to learn about new technologies that had been developed there during World War II. Van Wijngaarden was intrigued by the new idea of automatic computing, and on 1 January 1947 he became the head of the Computing Department of the brand-new Mathematisch Centrum (MC) in Amsterdam. He then made further visits to England and the United States, gathering ideas for the construction of the first Dutch computer, the ARRA, an electromechanical construction first demonstrated in 1952. In that same year, van Wijngaarden hired Edsger Dijkstra, and they worked on software for the ARRA. While visiting Edinburgh in 1958, van Wijngaarden was seriously injured in an automobile accident in which his wife was killed. After he recovered, he focused more on programming language research, and was one of the designers of the original ALGOL, and later ALGOL 68, for which he developed a two-level type of grammar that came be known as van Wijngaarden grammars. He became the director of the MC in 1961, and remained in that post for the next twenty years.
Nobuo Yoneda was a Japanese mathematician and computer scientist. The Yoneda lemma in category theory is named after him. In computer science, he is known for his work on ALGOL dialects.
